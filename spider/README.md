# Twitter Spider

This is a spidering project that uses the Twitter API to find the people the user has followed on Twitter. The user of the code has to enter his username and his 
special keys in hidden.py to make sure that the program runs. The project uses some external code from http://www.py4e.com/ check it out.

The project is using a secure API, hence need for hidden key-value pairs, etc. The twitter url is also very difficult to form therefore oauth.py and twurl.py is
used.
